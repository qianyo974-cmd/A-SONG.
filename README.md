## Introduction 
"A Song." is a sound-driven audio-visual work based on p5.js. The work uses built-in audio as input and controls the movement and rhythm in the picture through changes in sound. When the sound starts playing, the notes, particles and forms in the picture will be activated accordingly, constantly moving, rotating or gathering in space. 
The variation in volume alters the movement pattern, speed and distribution of the notes, presenting different rhythms and moods in the visuals. By pressing keys A or B, the audience can enter different scenes, each corresponding to a distinct relationship between sound and vision. 
"A Song." can be run directly as a code project to present a complete audio-visual experience on the screen; it can also be displayed in combination with a simple physical arrangement. In the video version, wooden stakes and stones are placed around the screen to form a viewing scene, making the digital images seem to occur in a confined space. These physical elements do not participate in the interaction but serve as an environment, allowing the audience to focus more on the relationship between sound and image. 

## 1. Display
"A Song." is mainly presented in the form of an audio-visual installation with physical arrangements. The work uses built-in audio for playback, and the visuals unfold in accordance with the structure of the sound rather than being generated in real time from external inputs. 

### Version One: Physical Device Demonstration Version (Main Display Method) 
The work is presented through projection, with the images cast onto wooden stakes, rocks or other physical materials with flat surfaces. These materials are arranged in the space to form a low, ground-level viewing field, making the images appear as if they are attached to the surfaces of the objects rather than being independent screen images. 
The wooden stakes and rocks are not used as interactive devices but as carriers of images, emphasizing the relationship between digital images and physical materials. The projection equipment can be placed in front of or above the installation, and the specific position can be adjusted according to the spatial conditions to ensure that the images are clearly visible. 
This version is the main form of presentation of the work. The audience experiences the relationship between sound and image by viewing the installation itself.

### Version Two: Simple Video Presentation Version (Document and Alternative Solutions) 
In the absence of the ability to set up a physical installation, "A Song" can also be presented by playing the video of the completed work. This video documents the actual presentation of the physical installation and serves as a documented version of the installation. 
In this version, the work is presented as a single video that loops continuously, without the need for any keyboard operations or scene changes. This format is suitable for online exhibitions, course submissions, or situations where space is limited.

## 2. Computer
"A Song." requires a computer device capable of stably playing audio and video content. The work is presented using built-in audio and pre-rendered video images. The performance requirements for the graphics card are moderate, but it is recommended to use a device with a dedicated graphics card or a relatively new integrated graphics card to ensure smooth playback. 
This work has been successfully run on the following devices: 

· Desktop Computer:

Windows desktop computer 

NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4080 Graphics Card 

16GB or more of memory 

Windows 10 / Windows 11

The video and audio playback runs smoothly. 

· Laptop: 

MacBook Pro (16-inch, 2021)

Intel processor

macOS

Built-in speaker or external speaker

The video playback and sound are synchronized stably.
The computer needs to be connected to the projection or display device via HDMI / DisplayPort / VGA / DVI, etc., and the sound is played through the system's built-in audio output or external speakers. 

Performance Notes:

On devices with lower performance or older models, the work can still run, but when played in high resolution or projected on a larger screen, there may be a decrease in the smoothness of the picture.
For the best display effect, it is recommended to use a computer with a dedicated graphics card or one that was released within the last five years.

## 3. Lighting
"A Song." has no specific requirements for a complex lighting system. The work is mainly presented through projection, so the exhibition space should maintain a relatively low ambient brightness to ensure that the notes, movement details, and rhythm changes in the projected images can be clearly seen. 
It is recommended that the work be installed in a dim or controllable light space to avoid strong natural light or direct light sources from entering the display area. Excessive ambient light will weaken the contrast of the projection, making it difficult to distinguish the movement and changes of the notes and the visual layers. 

If basic lighting is required, it should be soft and indirect ambient light, only used to ensure the basic visibility of the audience, without directly illuminating the projection area or the physical surface carrying the projection (such as wooden stakes or rocks). 
Ideally, the work should be displayed away from bright windows or high-lit background walls to achieve the best projection effect.

## 4. Text
"A Song", 2026 Yosheng Qian

"A Song." is an audio-visual work based on sound. The piece uses built-in audio as input and controls the movement of notes and graphics in space through computational rules. The rhythm and intensity of the sound affect the changes in the picture, creating a continuous connection between the visual and the auditory. 

The work can be presented through projection and combined with physical materials such as wooden stakes or rocks for display. The images are projected onto the surfaces of these objects, creating a connection between the digital images and the specific materials.
